This repository are attempts to analyze historic lottery data and provide predictions.

# Summary
While the lottery is a purely probabilitic game, this project attempts to give an engineering perspective to the challenge.

For simplicity, let's assume that the lottery game consist of a random draw of 6 balls from a set of 60. 
Probability established that if all draws are independent and random, the following are all completely possible outcomes:
  - All numbers are consecutive
  - The same set of numbers can be drawed multiple times

In reality, scenarios as the above are unheard one (it could be argued this is due to their low probability).

This repository is an attempt to take a look at historical lottery data, and see if there are any of such of pattenrs on the data collected.
